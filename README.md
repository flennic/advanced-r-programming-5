Repository for the course 732A94 Advanced Programming in R at LinkÃ¶ping University 2018. Assignment 5.

## ToDo

- Reach a consensus on what API to use
  - `Maximilian:` Based on what he told is, we should go for an easy approach. I doesn't really help us doing something exordinary. I prefer `Valmyndigheten XML` or `Kolada API`. Any thoughts on this?
- Based on the API choose the functionality of the Shiny application and its name.

- "At least one interactive widget should be used." -> Seems like nothing to "fancy"
- Package documentation
- Unit Tests
- Vignette
